## Open Access Reliability Engineering Programming Language (OAREPL)

OAREPL is a project aimed at enhancing automation processes and improving system efficiency through the use of Python and Bash scripting. This project is designed for engineers who are looking to implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Azure and Terraform, as well as focusing on unit testing in C/C++ and C#.

### Features

- Automation of processes using Python and Bash scripting
- Implementation of CI/CD pipelines with Azure and Terraform
- Unit testing capabilities for C/C++ and C#
- Enhanced productivity for Linux system administration

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Bash, C, C++, C#
- **Cloud Services**: Azure
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Testing Frameworks**:
     (Possible frameworks to be used for unit testing.)
      <br>Examples: Python(`unittest` for basic testing | `pytest` for advanced testing capabilities) | C/C++(`Google Test` for comprehensive C++ testing | `Catch2` for modern C++ testing) | C#(`NUnit` for .NET unit testing | `xUnit` for community-focused testing)
                 

### Getting Started

To get started with OAREPL, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thaumaturgists/OAREPL.git
   cd OAREPL
   ```
2. Install the [required dependencies](requirements.txt):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - Plans to revolve for `poetry`
3. **C/C++/C# Dependencies**
   - [C/C++ Dependencies](CMakeLists.txt)
   ```
   C/C++ are managed using CMake. Please refer to the <CMakeLists.txt> file for details on how to build the project.
   ```

   - [C# Dependencies](.csproj)
   ```
   C# dependencies are managed through NuGet. You can find the necessary packages in the <.csproj> file.
   ```
4. Set up your Azure and Terraform environment (provided specific instructions here: [Skilled in Maneuvering](remunerator.man)).

### Usage

Provide examples of how to use the scripts and tools included in the project.
    For instance:
    
    
    # Example command to run a Python script
    python script.py
    
    
    # Example command to deploy using Terraform
    terraform apply
